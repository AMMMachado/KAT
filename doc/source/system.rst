System requirements
===================

KAT supports Unix, linux or Mac systems.  Windows may work but hasn't been
tested.  A minimum of 8GB RAM, which will enable you to process small - medium sized datasets.  
Large datasets will require more RAM (potentially a lot more), the actual amount of
memory required depends on the size of the genome's to be processed and the size of
your initial datasets.
